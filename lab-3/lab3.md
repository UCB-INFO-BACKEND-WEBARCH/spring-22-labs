# Step 1 â€” Setting up the Database

First, we set up the SQLite database (sqlite3 module) to store and retrieve our data

Data in SQLite is stored in tables and columns, so we first need to create a table called posts with the necessary columns. We create a .sql file that contains SQL commands to create the cats table with a few columns. We then use this schema file to create the database.

Open a database schema file called schema.sql inside your cats_app directory:

```
nano schema.sql
```
